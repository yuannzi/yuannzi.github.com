Things to improve upon.

1. You read about iOS development. 
    * [CocoaChina](http://www.cocoachina.com)
    * [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/)
    * [objc.io](http://www.objc.io/)

2. You follow the right people on Twitter. 

    Meh, I don't use twitter that much. I usually listens to podcasts such as IT公论, 内核恐慌, iPhreaks...

3. You know where the iOS development landscape is headed.
  
    Well, this requires more thinking..
