As I grow bored of Courier New, I set out to find a new font for programming.

It's a little bit weird but I found that having a good font makes me wanna type more, whereas a bad font makes me feel unproductive.

Google gives <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts">top 10 programming fonts</a>.

I browsed through the list and found that <a href="http://www.proggyfonts.net">proggy clean</a> is the font I like most in terminal.

It's best in size 11 and looks squarish enough for my taste.

    Proggy is a clean monospace font that seems to be favored by Windows users, although it works fine on a Mac. It’s a clean font intended to be used only at smaller points, and without anti-aliasing.


I also likes <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> when it comes to text editor. It is not as small as proggy clean.

    Inconsolata is my favorite monospaced font, and it’s free. Shortly after discovering it, it quickly supplanted Deja Vu Sans Mono as my go-to programming font. I use it everywhere, from Terminal windows to code editors. It has a certain sublime style that’s unique without being over the top, and it looks fantastic at both large and small sizes. I use this font when I show code samples in a presentation, and it’s the font we use in Terminal and TextMate windows when filming PeepCode screencasts.

    Inconsolata is designed to be used with anti-aliasing enabled, but it’s surprisingly legible even at very small sizes. A big thanks to Raph Levien for creating this font, and for making it free.
